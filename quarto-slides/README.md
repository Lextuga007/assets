## Quarto slides

For the NHS-R Community training there are some slides and code that are repeated through the repositories including a break slide and the `nhsr-quarto.css`.

The slides are published through this repository and via a redirect to the nhsrcommunity.com url name so should be viewable even where there are IT restrictions on accesing GitHub published pages:
