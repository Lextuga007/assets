## Logos

This repository has two version of the NHS-R Community logo, `png` and `svg`.

Each can be linked to generally in code using html and we highly recommend including this code in its entirety for the inclusion of the alt text:

Use html code:

```         
<a alt="NHS-R Community" href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg' align="center" height="80" /></a>
```

or using markdown:

```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg){align="center" alt="NHS-R Community" height="80"}
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg){align="center" alt="NHS-R Community" height="80"}
