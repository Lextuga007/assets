## Logos

This repository has two version of the NHS-R Community logo, `png` and `svg`.

Each can be linked to generally in code using html and we highly recommend including this code in its entirety for the inclusion of the alt text:

Use code like:

```
<a alt="NHS-R Community's logo" href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg' align="right" height="80" /></a>
```

Rendered:

<a alt="NHS-R Community's logo" href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg' align="right" height="80" /></a>
